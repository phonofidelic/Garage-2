    This Garage Parking application is a student project developed as part of a class assignment. The purpose of the application is to demonstrate functionality such as vehicle registration, parking management, and basic data handling using ASP.NET MVC.
    We take user privacy seriously, even in an educational context.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
    The application may collect the following information for demonstration purposes only:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Vehicle information (e.g. registration number, vehicle type, color)</li>
    <li>Parking timestamps (check-in and check-out times)</li>
    <li>Optional user-provided identifiers (such as a name or reference ID, if included in the project)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    No sensitive personal information (such as personal identification numbers, passwords, or payment details) is required or stored.
</p>

<h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
<p>
    The collected information is used solely to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Manage parking sessions within the application</li>
    <li>Display parked vehicles and parking history</li>
    <li>Demonstrate CRUD operations, business logic, and MVC patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The data is <strong>not</strong> used for analytics, marketing, or tracking purposes.
</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>
    All data is stored locally in the application’s database and is used only during the runtime of the project or for evaluation purposes.
    Data may be reset, modified, or deleted at any time by the application administrators (students or instructors).
</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>

</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
    This application does not use cookies for tracking or profiling users.
    Any cookies used are limited to essential functionality (such as session handling) provided by the ASP.NET framework.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
    Reasonable measures are taken to protect stored data, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Controlled access to the application</li>
    <li>Basic validation and error handling</li>
</ul>

<p>
    However, since this is a student project, it should not be considered production-grade or suitable for real-world sensitive data.
